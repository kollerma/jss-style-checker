### Findings / suggestions

Unlabelled batch-of-50 analysis surfaced nine candidate improvements, ranked by
leverage:

| # | change | impact | surface | risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Strip Markdown `` `…` `` inline code spans in Rmd prose | ~500–800 FPs in MARKUP-001/002/003 | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup (`year`/`YEAR`, `doi`/`DOI`) | ~60–100 TP→FP flips on .bib | 6 rule files | low |
| P3 | Register `!r`/`!expr` YAML constructor for Rmd frontmatter | unblocks `cran_brms` parse | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates → info rule | unblocks `cran_rpart`, `cran_robustbase` bibs | `core/parser.py` + new rule | medium |
| P2 | REFS-006 first-word-caps carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | ~30–50 FPs | `references.py::_strip_latex` | low |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the `for tex` loop | 12 Rmd FPs | `citations.py:74` | low |
| P5 | Rephrase REFS-003 message ("where one is available") | noise reduction | catalogue data | trivial |

Bib-scoped rules that now fire via `--pinned-only`: REFS-001, REFS-003, REFS-004,
REFS-005, REFS-006, REFS-007, BIBTEX-002/003/004 — bib files sit alongside the
pinned vignette on disk and the `--pinned-only` filter includes them.

### Plan

Order for the next iteration: P1 first (biggest volume, mechanical), then P6
(widespread correctness bug affecting bib rules). Re-scan and re-measure before
touching P2/P3/P4/P7. P5 is trivial and can ride with P6.

Todos:
- [ ] P1: strip `` `…` `` code spans from Rmd prose in `core/rmd_parser.py`
- [ ] P6: introduce `_lc_fields(entry)` helper and replace case-sensitive lookups in `rules/{references,bibtex,house_style,naming}.py`
- [ ] Re-scan with `--force` and `eval-jss iterate record` as "post-P1+P6"

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 2. Key numbers:

- **Total violations**: 3848 → 2422 (**-37%**).
- **JSS-MARKUP-003** (inline-code / function-call names): 961 → 165 (**-83%**) — driven by P1 (Rmd ```…``` strip).
- **JSS-REFS-003** (missing DOI): 581 → 170 (**-71%**) — driven by the cited-only bib scope (separate commit, not in the original P1/P6 plan).
- **JSS-BIBTEX-003** (required fields): 84 → 45 (-46%); **JSS-REFS-001** (year): 76 → 45 (-41%); **JSS-REFS-006** dropped out of the top 10.
- **JSS-MARKUP-001**: 706 → 764 (**+8%**) — net +58 is Stan-as-a-language (added per reviewer note); backtick stripping removed most of the legacy FP pool but Stan TPs outnumber the savings.

Not yet shipped from the original plan: P6 (case-insensitive bib field lookup — `YEAR` vs `year`), P2 (REFS-006 `\pkg{…}:` carve-out), P3 (`!r` YAML tag), P4 (soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates), P7 (CITE-002 `seen` set). These are queued for iteration 3.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-04-24T19:09:49Z — post-baseline

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Iteration 1 close. Implemented P1 (strip Rmd inline code spans), plus 5 FP-killers from human-review comments: R^2 exemption, SweaveOpts/VignetteIndexEntry meta macros, \code{}-identifier pass-through, scientific-notation mask in CODE-003, Stan added to LANGUAGES. Also scoped bib rules to cited-only entries. Total 3848 → 2422 (-37%).

### Findings / suggestions

Iteration 2 was a close-out record for iteration 1's plan, not a fresh
analysis pass. Carry-over candidates from iteration 1's unfinished plan:

| # | change | notes |
|---|---|---|
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup | BibTeX allows `YEAR`/`DOI`/`AUTHOR`; rules currently `entry.fields_dict.get("year")` and miss uppercase. Re-verify impact under the new cited-only scope. |
| P2 | REFS-006 carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | First-word-caps check currently trips on package names after `_strip_latex` removes the wrapper. |
| P3 | `!r` / `!expr` YAML tag in Rmd frontmatter | Unblocks `cran_brms` whose fenced chunks use `!r` — currently emits `JSS-PARSE-000`. |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicate-key error | Duplicate keys still blow up the whole bib parse; convert to an info-severity rule so the rest of the bib is still lintable. |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the per-tex loop | Rmd-only FP: each prose block re-asks for a citation on the same `\pkg{X}`. |

### Plan

Next iteration (3) starts with a corpus expansion (`/eval-add-corpus`),
then cycles through the steps. Carry forward P6/P2/P3/P4/P7 above as the
candidate list to refine after human review of the new batch.

### Results (post-implementation)

_(fill in after the next `eval-jss iterate record` run)_

## Iteration 3 — 2026-04-25T11:18:15Z — post-iter2

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** P6 case-insensitive bib fields, P7 CITE-002 seen-set hoist, CAP sentence-case heuristic upgrade (sub-sentence boundaries + abbreviation/mixed-case carve-outs), OPER-003/TYPO-004 narrowed to .tex. BIBTEX-003 22% → small-sample, REFS-001 44% → 100%, CAP-002 76% → 88%, CAP-003 8 of 15 FPs eliminated.

## Iteration 4 — 2026-04-25T12:56:40Z — post-cap-fixes

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Continued iteration 2 close: CAP family now passes. CAP-001 12.5% → 100%, CAP-002 87.6% → 98.0%, CAP-003 no longer fires on previously-FP rows. Five mechanisms: restored hyphen split, skip single-letter caps, expanded proper-noun list (nationalities + eponyms + corpus names), markup-macro args excluded from plain-text scan, CAP-001 skips stopword-only/known-pkg/function-call titles.

## Iteration 5 — 2026-04-25T19:05:25Z — post-spot-check

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Coverage spot-check on six AI-only rules. JSS-REFS-006 rubber-stamping uncovered: 5 of 6 human re-verifications flipped from TP to FP. Other five rules confirmed AI correct on human sample.
