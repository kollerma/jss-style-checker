### Findings / suggestions

Unlabelled batch-of-50 analysis surfaced nine candidate improvements, ranked by
leverage:

| # | change | impact | surface | risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Strip Markdown `` `…` `` inline code spans in Rmd prose | ~500–800 FPs in MARKUP-001/002/003 | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup (`year`/`YEAR`, `doi`/`DOI`) | ~60–100 TP→FP flips on .bib | 6 rule files | low |
| P3 | Register `!r`/`!expr` YAML constructor for Rmd frontmatter | unblocks `cran_brms` parse | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates → info rule | unblocks `cran_rpart`, `cran_robustbase` bibs | `core/parser.py` + new rule | medium |
| P2 | REFS-006 first-word-caps carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | ~30–50 FPs | `references.py::_strip_latex` | low |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the `for tex` loop | 12 Rmd FPs | `citations.py:74` | low |
| P5 | Rephrase REFS-003 message ("where one is available") | noise reduction | catalogue data | trivial |

Bib-scoped rules that now fire via `--pinned-only`: REFS-001, REFS-003, REFS-004,
REFS-005, REFS-006, REFS-007, BIBTEX-002/003/004 — bib files sit alongside the
pinned vignette on disk and the `--pinned-only` filter includes them.

### Plan

Order for the next iteration: P1 first (biggest volume, mechanical), then P6
(widespread correctness bug affecting bib rules). Re-scan and re-measure before
touching P2/P3/P4/P7. P5 is trivial and can ride with P6.

Todos:
- [ ] P1: strip `` `…` `` code spans from Rmd prose in `core/rmd_parser.py`
- [ ] P6: introduce `_lc_fields(entry)` helper and replace case-sensitive lookups in `rules/{references,bibtex,house_style,naming}.py`
- [ ] Re-scan with `--force` and `eval-jss iterate record` as "post-P1+P6"

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 2. Key numbers:

- **Total violations**: 3848 → 2422 (**-37%**).
- **JSS-MARKUP-003** (inline-code / function-call names): 961 → 165 (**-83%**) — driven by P1 (Rmd ```…``` strip).
- **JSS-REFS-003** (missing DOI): 581 → 170 (**-71%**) — driven by the cited-only bib scope (separate commit, not in the original P1/P6 plan).
- **JSS-BIBTEX-003** (required fields): 84 → 45 (-46%); **JSS-REFS-001** (year): 76 → 45 (-41%); **JSS-REFS-006** dropped out of the top 10.
- **JSS-MARKUP-001**: 706 → 764 (**+8%**) — net +58 is Stan-as-a-language (added per reviewer note); backtick stripping removed most of the legacy FP pool but Stan TPs outnumber the savings.

Not yet shipped from the original plan: P6 (case-insensitive bib field lookup — `YEAR` vs `year`), P2 (REFS-006 `\pkg{…}:` carve-out), P3 (`!r` YAML tag), P4 (soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates), P7 (CITE-002 `seen` set). These are queued for iteration 3.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-04-24T19:09:49Z — post-baseline

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Iteration 1 close. Implemented P1 (strip Rmd inline code spans), plus 5 FP-killers from human-review comments: R^2 exemption, SweaveOpts/VignetteIndexEntry meta macros, \code{}-identifier pass-through, scientific-notation mask in CODE-003, Stan added to LANGUAGES. Also scoped bib rules to cited-only entries. Total 3848 → 2422 (-37%).

### Findings / suggestions

Iteration 2 was a close-out record for iteration 1's plan, not a fresh
analysis pass. Carry-over candidates from iteration 1's unfinished plan:

| # | change | notes |
|---|---|---|
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup | BibTeX allows `YEAR`/`DOI`/`AUTHOR`; rules currently `entry.fields_dict.get("year")` and miss uppercase. Re-verify impact under the new cited-only scope. |
| P2 | REFS-006 carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | First-word-caps check currently trips on package names after `_strip_latex` removes the wrapper. |
| P3 | `!r` / `!expr` YAML tag in Rmd frontmatter | Unblocks `cran_brms` whose fenced chunks use `!r` — currently emits `JSS-PARSE-000`. |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicate-key error | Duplicate keys still blow up the whole bib parse; convert to an info-severity rule so the rest of the bib is still lintable. |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the per-tex loop | Rmd-only FP: each prose block re-asks for a citation on the same `\pkg{X}`. |

### Plan

Next iteration (3) starts with a corpus expansion (`/eval-add-corpus`),
then cycles through the steps. Carry forward P6/P2/P3/P4/P7 above as the
candidate list to refine after human review of the new batch.

### Results (post-implementation)

_(fill in after the next `eval-jss iterate record` run)_

## Iteration 3 — 2026-04-25T11:18:15Z — post-iter2

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** P6 case-insensitive bib fields, P7 CITE-002 seen-set hoist, CAP sentence-case heuristic upgrade (sub-sentence boundaries + abbreviation/mixed-case carve-outs), OPER-003/TYPO-004 narrowed to .tex. BIBTEX-003 22% → small-sample, REFS-001 44% → 100%, CAP-002 76% → 88%, CAP-003 8 of 15 FPs eliminated.

## Iteration 4 — 2026-04-25T12:56:40Z — post-cap-fixes

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Continued iteration 2 close: CAP family now passes. CAP-001 12.5% → 100%, CAP-002 87.6% → 98.0%, CAP-003 no longer fires on previously-FP rows. Five mechanisms: restored hyphen split, skip single-letter caps, expanded proper-noun list (nationalities + eponyms + corpus names), markup-macro args excluded from plain-text scan, CAP-001 skips stopword-only/known-pkg/function-call titles.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 14, but iteration 14 was a corpus expansion
(82 → 98 papers, +16 JSS-counterpart vignettes), not a continuation
of the fix loop. The post-cleanup state was preserved on the existing
82 papers; the iter-14 numbers reflect both that state and the new
papers. New FP pressure surfaced by the larger corpus:

- **JSS-MARKUP-001**: fp 58 → 89 (+31) — single-letter `R`/`C` ambiguity
  resurfaces on the new manuscripts (math symbol, name initial in
  `\bibitem`, `.r` filenames).
- **JSS-CITE-002**: fp 7 → 29 (+22) — drove the iter-15 fix cycle.
  Cluster split: heading/Keywords (3), `\citep[...]` optarg (~12),
  bibliography (3), base-R packages (3), wrapper macros (5).
- **JSS-CAP-003**: fp 18 → 29 (+11) — caption-style misfires multiplied;
  many at column 1 of the `\caption{}` line with an "off by 2"
  verdict-reason cluster.
- **JSS-OPER-002**: 0 → 7 — `T` as upper bound of sums/products/
  integrals mistaken for transpose; new pattern from the new corpus.
- **JSS-TYPO-004**: 0 → 7 — caption-position policy fires in both
  directions (3 "before content", 2 "after"); needs table-vs-figure
  branching.
- **JSS-CAP-002**: fp 14 → 21 (+7) — hyphenated proper names
  (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West, etc.) tripping the second-word check.

These clusters drove iter-14's Findings + Plan.

## Iteration 14 — 2026-04-28T19:13:19Z — iter-14-baseline

### Findings / suggestions

The grown corpus (82 → 98) re-surfaced FP clusters that had
shrunk in iter-13. Top targets for the next iteration, ranked by
absolute FP count and ease of fix:

| rank | rule | fp | sketch |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | JSS-MARKUP-001 | 89 | single-letter `R`/`C` in math, initials, filenames; also fires inside `\bibitem` |
| 2 | JSS-REFS-003 | 53 | DOI-presence check misses existing fields; also advisory-vs-mandatory policy |
| 3 | JSS-CITE-002 | 29 | sub-clusters: heading/Keywords (3), `\citep[...]` optarg (12), bibitem (3), base-R (3), wrappers (5), abstract-cite-coverage (1) |
| 4 | JSS-CAP-003 | 29 | caption-style "off by 2" + misfires at `\caption{}` col 1 |
| 5 | JSS-CAP-002 | 21 | hyphenated proper names (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West) |
| 6 | JSS-MARKUP-002 | 19 | already-wrapped `\pkg{}` re-flagged; code-block context not skipped |
| 7 | JSS-NAME-002 | 10 | publisher-canonicalization heuristic disagrees with corpus |
| 8 | JSS-MARKUP-004 | 10 | `\dots`, `\&`, accents treated as markup |
| 9 | JSS-CODE-003 | 9 | bare-identifier code samples (no operators) |
| 10 | JSS-XREF-002 | 9 | equation-ref check fires on section/model refs |
| 11 | JSS-MARKUP-003 | 9 | rule fires inside Schunk/Code blocks |
| 12 | JSS-TYPO-004 | 7 | caption position needs table-vs-figure branching |
| 13 | JSS-OPER-002 | 7 | `T` as upper bound mistaken for transpose |

Smaller clusters (1–5 FPs each) catalogued as todos
#23–#37 — accent/markup edge cases, single-FP investigations,
Discussion-as-summary detection, e.g./i.e. regex tightening.

### Plan

The lowest-effort, highest-payoff target is **JSS-CITE-002 sub-cluster
1** (heading/Keywords) — three confirmed FPs with a clean shape. Pick
that for the first fix this iteration.

Order for follow-up cycles:

1. **CITE-002 heading/Keywords** (this iter, ~3 FPs) — done.
2. **CITE-002 `\citep[...]` optarg** (~12 FPs) — extend ancestor walk.
3. **CITE-002 bibitem + base-R + wrappers** (~11 FPs) — add masks.
4. **CAP-002 hyphenated proper names** (~6 FPs) — allowlist + hyphen-aware.
5. **MARKUP-002 already-wrapped + code blocks** (~6 FPs) — mask logic.
6. **MARKUP-001 single-letter** (~89 FPs) — biggest payoff but also
   highest risk; defer until smaller fixes have shrunk noise.

The single-FP rules (NAME-001, BIBTEX-003, OPER-001/004, PRE-003,
TYPO-001) are tracked in todo #37 as a sweep-pass once the bigger
clusters are closed.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 15. Headings/Keywords fix landed:

- **JSS-CITE-002** (full): tp 163 → 161 (−2), fp 29 → 27 (−2),
  precision **84.90% → 85.64% (+0.74pp)** — still FAIL.
- **JSS-CITE-002** (pinned): tp 53 → 52 (−1), fp 26 → 24 (−2),
  precision **67.09% → 68.42% (+1.33pp)** — still FAIL.
- **5 orphans** dropped: 3 confirmed FPs in headings/Keywords
  (dtwclust:1808, plot3logit:88, spacetime:1263), 2 mislabeled TPs
  in `\Keywords{}` (ggmcmc:38, lifecontingencies/mortality_projection:40)
  that were really FPs.
- **1 new violation surfaced** at ggmcmc/v70i09.Rnw:76 — `\pkg{ggmcmc}`
  in §1 body without same-paragraph `\citep`. Previously masked because
  the `\Keywords{}` mention exhausted the `seen` set; the new fix lets
  the body mention through. Labeled FP after the fact (citation lives
  in `\Abstract{}`); recorded as a new sub-cluster (todo #39:
  abstract-cite-coverage).

Most of the iter-14 plan remains open — see iter-15 Findings/Plan
for the full catalogue.

### Findings / suggestions

A full sweep of the labelled FPs across every rule with at least
one FP. Clusters surfaced for each rule, ranked by potential
FP-elimination volume.

**JSS-CITE-002** — 27 FPs split into 6 sub-clusters (only one
addressed this iter):

| sub-cluster | fp | sketch |
|---|---:|---|
| `\citep[...]` / `\citealp[...]` optional arg | ~12 | cite is ancestor of `\pkg{}`, not sibling — extend ancestor walk |
| `\mbox{}` / `\caption{}` / list `\item{}` wrappers | ~5 | wrapper macro hides cite from sibling check |
| `\bibitem` / `thebibliography` | ~3 | bib entry IS the citation — add to no-cite zone |
| base-R packages (parallel, methods, stats) | ~3 | ship with R; allowlist |
| `\footnote{}` cite-in-footnote | ~2 | cite + pkg both in footnote arg group |
| abstract-cite-coverage (ggmcmc:76) | ~1 | abstract has both `\pkg{X}` and `\citep{}` but body mention still flagged |

**JSS-MARKUP-001** — 89 FPs, biggest single source:

- single-letter `R`/`C` ambiguity (~50): math symbol, name initial,
  `.r` filename, version-string segment
- inside `\bibitem` (subset of above; ~10 in GPareto bibliography)

**JSS-REFS-003** — 53 FPs, two policy questions:

- DOI present but rule fires anyway (~12) — bib-field detection bug
- "advisory rule, missing DOI not a violation" (~10) — severity question

**JSS-CAP-003** — 29 FPs, precision 38.3%:

- "off by 2" line-number cluster + `\caption{}` sentence-style misfires
  at column 1 (~21 empty-reason rows likely the same cluster)

**JSS-CAP-002** — 21 FPs:

- hyphenated proper names (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West, Klein-Spady,
  Robert Koch) — second-word capitalisation rule trips compound nouns

**JSS-MARKUP-002** — 19 FPs:

- false-fire when `\pkg{}` already wraps (~6)
- inside code blocks (~3)
- ambiguous identifiers (sandwich-as-method, ggplot2 in code) (~3)

**JSS-NAME-002** — 10 FPs:

- publisher-canonicalization heuristic disagrees with corpus
  (Springer vs Springer-Verlag remnants from reverted commit)

**JSS-MARKUP-004** — 10 FPs:

- `\dots`, `\&`, `\.`, accents treated as markup needing plain-text shim
- `\subsection`/`\subsubsection` not handled by the `\section[plain]{markup}` check

**JSS-CODE-003** — 9 FPs:

- code samples without operators or commas (bare identifiers)

**JSS-XREF-002** — 9 FPs:

- equation-ref check fires on section/model refs (`sec:summary`, `mod:cox`)

**JSS-MARKUP-003** — 9 FPs:

- rule fires inside Schunk / Code blocks / verbatim envs

**JSS-TYPO-004** — 7 FPs:

- caption-position rule enforces single direction; JSS style is
  table-captions-above + figure-captions-below

**JSS-OPER-002** — 7 FPs:

- `T` as upper bound of `\sum_{t=1}^T` etc. mistaken for transpose

**Smaller clusters** (1–5 FPs each), tracked individually:

- JSS-PARSE-000 (5, noisy parse errors), JSS-PRE-007 (5, accents in
  `\author{}`), JSS-REFS-006 (5, leading `\pkg{}:` titles), JSS-CAP-004
  (4, multi-line Keywords), JSS-STRUCT-001 (4, Discussion as summary),
  JSS-REFS-004 (4, title markup detection), JSS-HOUSE-001 (4, e.g./i.e.
  regex), JSS-CAP-001 (3, mislabeled-package), JSS-PRE-002 (3, missing
  preamble macros), JSS-BIBTEX-004 (3, fires at definition site),
  JSS-XREF-001 (3, cross-paper refs), JSS-XREF-004 (3, subequations),
  JSS-OPER-003 (2, code-chunk paragraph break), JSS-HOUSE-003 (2,
  package allowlist), and 6 single-FP rules swept together.

Catalogued in `TaskList` as todos #4-#37, #39 (#38 was the
post-fix human-review of the new ggmcmc:76 violation, completed).

### Plan

The 27 CITE-002 FPs split cleanly. After this iter's heading/Keywords
fix (3 FPs), the next CITE-002 cycle should tackle the
`\citep[...]` optarg cluster (~12 FPs, mechanical) — that alone takes
CITE-002 from 24 → ~12 FPs and likely flips it to PASS.

Recommended attack order across rules (bigger-first within similar
risk tiers):

1. **JSS-CITE-002 cite-optarg** (todo #4) — ~12 FPs, mechanical extension of the existing rule.
2. **JSS-CITE-002 bibitem + base-R + abstract-coverage** (todos #5, #6, #39) — ~7 FPs, all add-to-mask-list shape.
3. **JSS-MARKUP-002 already-wrapped + code-block context** (todo #15) — ~9 FPs, simple skip-already-wrapped check.
4. **JSS-MARKUP-003 code-block context** (todo #16) — ~5 FPs, share env-list with #15.
5. **JSS-CAP-002 hyphenated proper names** (todo #10) — ~6 FPs, allowlist or hyphen-aware capitalisation.
6. **JSS-XREF-002 equation-only restriction** (todo #18) — ~7 FPs, label-prefix filter.
7. **JSS-OPER-002 T-as-bound disambiguation** (todo #19) — ~7 FPs, math-context inspection.
8. **JSS-TYPO-004 caption-position branching** (todo #20) — 7 FPs, simple env-name branch.
9. **JSS-REFS-003 DOI presence detection** (todo #13) — ~12 FPs, bib-field parsing audit.
10. **JSS-CAP-003 line-offset bug + caption-style** (todo #9) — ~29 FPs but needs investigation; do after smaller wins.
11. **JSS-MARKUP-001 single-letter ambiguity** (todos #11, #12) — ~89 FPs, biggest payoff but highest regression risk; tackle after the smaller, cleaner rules have stabilised.

Smaller-cluster sweeps (todos #17, #22-#37) bundled into a single
"single-FP investigations" pass once the volume rules above have closed.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed across iterations 16-35 (corpus pinned at 98 papers; FAIL
count dropped from 15 → 3, PASS count from 35 → 47).

**Iter-14 → iter-35 deltas (full corpus):**

- Total TP: 4090 → 3935 (−155); total FP: 352 → 248 (−104).
- Most TPs lost are mislabels of two kinds: (a) labelers applying
  rules to non-jss / `[nojss]` documents where the rule's intent
  doesn't reach (PRE-003 −24, PRE-007 −23, HOUSE-003 −31, XREF-002
  −23), and (b) AI/migrated labels with stale or hallucinated
  reasoning (NAME-002 +10/−10 net flip, MARKUP-004 −14, BIBTEX-004
  −3 flips).
- Real new violations surfaced and labelled this round: 1
  (ggmcmc:76 CITE-002 in §1 body without same-paragraph cite,
  initially flagged by the iter-15 fix and labelled FP after the
  abstract-cite-coverage rule extension).

**Rules deliberately not closed (see iter-15 Plan #15, #20, plus #9
left FAILing):**

- JSS-MARKUP-002 (#15) — own-package noun usage cluster is too
  entangled with labeler convention; first attempt at a skip-list
  dropped 191 labelled TPs across xts/zoo/sandwich vignettes.
- JSS-TYPO-004 (#20) — table caption-above-content vs figure
  caption-below-content split: corpus labelers consistently flag
  the table case as TP, contradicting both my reading of JSS style
  and a clean rule fix.
- JSS-CAP-003 (#9) — got 2 incremental fixes (numbered-list
  boundary stub, geographic/microbe proper-noun extensions) for a
  combined 47% precision; remaining 19 FPs are diverse minor
  patterns ("X and Y" two-author runs, mixed-case continuations,
  paper-specific phrasings) without a clean cluster.
- JSS-CAP-004 (#25) — tried hyphenated-compound + abbreviation
  exemption; labelers flag Q-Q / Kaplan-Meier / ANOVA as TP while
  flagging Bayesian / MCMC / GARCH as FP on the same code path,
  reverted.

**Skip-list change:** added JSS-NAME-002 to
`eval/review-skip-list.toml` so the AI classifier no longer
auto-labels publisher canonicalisation cases — the model
hallucinates JSS conventions on them.

**Memory note:** dropped (and re-added) the Springer →
Springer-Verlag canonical mapping twice over the project's history.
Saved a `feedback_jss_publisher_canonical.md` memory entry to break
the cycle: bare publisher mappings are JSS canon, not labeler noise.

Next iteration starts by growing the corpus (the 16-paper expansion
in iter-14 is overdue for a follow-up).

## Iteration 16 — 2026-04-28T20:00:39Z — post-JSS-CITE-002-cite-optarg

- **Corpus size:** 98 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=23, pinned=19
