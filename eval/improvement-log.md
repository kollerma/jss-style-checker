### Findings / suggestions

Unlabelled batch-of-50 analysis surfaced nine candidate improvements, ranked by
leverage:

| # | change | impact | surface | risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Strip Markdown `` `…` `` inline code spans in Rmd prose | ~500–800 FPs in MARKUP-001/002/003 | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup (`year`/`YEAR`, `doi`/`DOI`) | ~60–100 TP→FP flips on .bib | 6 rule files | low |
| P3 | Register `!r`/`!expr` YAML constructor for Rmd frontmatter | unblocks `cran_brms` parse | `core/rmd_parser.py` | low |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates → info rule | unblocks `cran_rpart`, `cran_robustbase` bibs | `core/parser.py` + new rule | medium |
| P2 | REFS-006 first-word-caps carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | ~30–50 FPs | `references.py::_strip_latex` | low |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the `for tex` loop | 12 Rmd FPs | `citations.py:74` | low |
| P5 | Rephrase REFS-003 message ("where one is available") | noise reduction | catalogue data | trivial |

Bib-scoped rules that now fire via `--pinned-only`: REFS-001, REFS-003, REFS-004,
REFS-005, REFS-006, REFS-007, BIBTEX-002/003/004 — bib files sit alongside the
pinned vignette on disk and the `--pinned-only` filter includes them.

### Plan

Order for the next iteration: P1 first (biggest volume, mechanical), then P6
(widespread correctness bug affecting bib rules). Re-scan and re-measure before
touching P2/P3/P4/P7. P5 is trivial and can ride with P6.

Todos:
- [ ] P1: strip `` `…` `` code spans from Rmd prose in `core/rmd_parser.py`
- [ ] P6: introduce `_lc_fields(entry)` helper and replace case-sensitive lookups in `rules/{references,bibtex,house_style,naming}.py`
- [ ] Re-scan with `--force` and `eval-jss iterate record` as "post-P1+P6"

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 2. Key numbers:

- **Total violations**: 3848 → 2422 (**-37%**).
- **JSS-MARKUP-003** (inline-code / function-call names): 961 → 165 (**-83%**) — driven by P1 (Rmd ```…``` strip).
- **JSS-REFS-003** (missing DOI): 581 → 170 (**-71%**) — driven by the cited-only bib scope (separate commit, not in the original P1/P6 plan).
- **JSS-BIBTEX-003** (required fields): 84 → 45 (-46%); **JSS-REFS-001** (year): 76 → 45 (-41%); **JSS-REFS-006** dropped out of the top 10.
- **JSS-MARKUP-001**: 706 → 764 (**+8%**) — net +58 is Stan-as-a-language (added per reviewer note); backtick stripping removed most of the legacy FP pool but Stan TPs outnumber the savings.

Not yet shipped from the original plan: P6 (case-insensitive bib field lookup — `YEAR` vs `year`), P2 (REFS-006 `\pkg{…}:` carve-out), P3 (`!r` YAML tag), P4 (soft-fail bibtexparser duplicates), P7 (CITE-002 `seen` set). These are queued for iteration 3.

## Iteration 2 — 2026-04-24T19:09:49Z — post-baseline

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Iteration 1 close. Implemented P1 (strip Rmd inline code spans), plus 5 FP-killers from human-review comments: R^2 exemption, SweaveOpts/VignetteIndexEntry meta macros, \code{}-identifier pass-through, scientific-notation mask in CODE-003, Stan added to LANGUAGES. Also scoped bib rules to cited-only entries. Total 3848 → 2422 (-37%).

### Findings / suggestions

Iteration 2 was a close-out record for iteration 1's plan, not a fresh
analysis pass. Carry-over candidates from iteration 1's unfinished plan:

| # | change | notes |
|---|---|---|
| P6 | Case-insensitive bib field lookup | BibTeX allows `YEAR`/`DOI`/`AUTHOR`; rules currently `entry.fields_dict.get("year")` and miss uppercase. Re-verify impact under the new cited-only scope. |
| P2 | REFS-006 carve-out for `\pkg{…}:` titles | First-word-caps check currently trips on package names after `_strip_latex` removes the wrapper. |
| P3 | `!r` / `!expr` YAML tag in Rmd frontmatter | Unblocks `cran_brms` whose fenced chunks use `!r` — currently emits `JSS-PARSE-000`. |
| P4 | Soft-fail bibtexparser duplicate-key error | Duplicate keys still blow up the whole bib parse; convert to an info-severity rule so the rest of the bib is still lintable. |
| P7 | Hoist `JSS-CITE-002` `seen` set above the per-tex loop | Rmd-only FP: each prose block re-asks for a citation on the same `\pkg{X}`. |

### Plan

Next iteration (3) starts with a corpus expansion (`/eval-add-corpus`),
then cycles through the steps. Carry forward P6/P2/P3/P4/P7 above as the
candidate list to refine after human review of the new batch.

### Results (post-implementation)

_(fill in after the next `eval-jss iterate record` run)_

## Iteration 3 — 2026-04-25T11:18:15Z — post-iter2

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** P6 case-insensitive bib fields, P7 CITE-002 seen-set hoist, CAP sentence-case heuristic upgrade (sub-sentence boundaries + abbreviation/mixed-case carve-outs), OPER-003/TYPO-004 narrowed to .tex. BIBTEX-003 22% → small-sample, REFS-001 44% → 100%, CAP-002 76% → 88%, CAP-003 8 of 15 FPs eliminated.

## Iteration 4 — 2026-04-25T12:56:40Z — post-cap-fixes

- **Corpus size:** 50 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=25, pinned=11

**Note:** Continued iteration 2 close: CAP family now passes. CAP-001 12.5% → 100%, CAP-002 87.6% → 98.0%, CAP-003 no longer fires on previously-FP rows. Five mechanisms: restored hyphen split, skip single-letter caps, expanded proper-noun list (nationalities + eponyms + corpus names), markup-macro args excluded from plain-text scan, CAP-001 skips stopword-only/known-pkg/function-call titles.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 14, but iteration 14 was a corpus expansion
(82 → 98 papers, +16 JSS-counterpart vignettes), not a continuation
of the fix loop. The post-cleanup state was preserved on the existing
82 papers; the iter-14 numbers reflect both that state and the new
papers. New FP pressure surfaced by the larger corpus:

- **JSS-MARKUP-001**: fp 58 → 89 (+31) — single-letter `R`/`C` ambiguity
  resurfaces on the new manuscripts (math symbol, name initial in
  `\bibitem`, `.r` filenames).
- **JSS-CITE-002**: fp 7 → 29 (+22) — drove the iter-15 fix cycle.
  Cluster split: heading/Keywords (3), `\citep[...]` optarg (~12),
  bibliography (3), base-R packages (3), wrapper macros (5).
- **JSS-CAP-003**: fp 18 → 29 (+11) — caption-style misfires multiplied;
  many at column 1 of the `\caption{}` line with an "off by 2"
  verdict-reason cluster.
- **JSS-OPER-002**: 0 → 7 — `T` as upper bound of sums/products/
  integrals mistaken for transpose; new pattern from the new corpus.
- **JSS-TYPO-004**: 0 → 7 — caption-position policy fires in both
  directions (3 "before content", 2 "after"); needs table-vs-figure
  branching.
- **JSS-CAP-002**: fp 14 → 21 (+7) — hyphenated proper names
  (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West, etc.) tripping the second-word check.

These clusters drove iter-14's Findings + Plan.

## Iteration 14 — 2026-04-28T19:13:19Z — iter-14-baseline

### Findings / suggestions

The grown corpus (82 → 98) re-surfaced FP clusters that had
shrunk in iter-13. Top targets for the next iteration, ranked by
absolute FP count and ease of fix:

| rank | rule | fp | sketch |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | JSS-MARKUP-001 | 89 | single-letter `R`/`C` in math, initials, filenames; also fires inside `\bibitem` |
| 2 | JSS-REFS-003 | 53 | DOI-presence check misses existing fields; also advisory-vs-mandatory policy |
| 3 | JSS-CITE-002 | 29 | sub-clusters: heading/Keywords (3), `\citep[...]` optarg (12), bibitem (3), base-R (3), wrappers (5), abstract-cite-coverage (1) |
| 4 | JSS-CAP-003 | 29 | caption-style "off by 2" + misfires at `\caption{}` col 1 |
| 5 | JSS-CAP-002 | 21 | hyphenated proper names (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West) |
| 6 | JSS-MARKUP-002 | 19 | already-wrapped `\pkg{}` re-flagged; code-block context not skipped |
| 7 | JSS-NAME-002 | 10 | publisher-canonicalization heuristic disagrees with corpus |
| 8 | JSS-MARKUP-004 | 10 | `\dots`, `\&`, accents treated as markup |
| 9 | JSS-CODE-003 | 9 | bare-identifier code samples (no operators) |
| 10 | JSS-XREF-002 | 9 | equation-ref check fires on section/model refs |
| 11 | JSS-MARKUP-003 | 9 | rule fires inside Schunk/Code blocks |
| 12 | JSS-TYPO-004 | 7 | caption position needs table-vs-figure branching |
| 13 | JSS-OPER-002 | 7 | `T` as upper bound mistaken for transpose |

Smaller clusters (1–5 FPs each) catalogued as todos
#23–#37 — accent/markup edge cases, single-FP investigations,
Discussion-as-summary detection, e.g./i.e. regex tightening.

### Plan

The lowest-effort, highest-payoff target is **JSS-CITE-002 sub-cluster
1** (heading/Keywords) — three confirmed FPs with a clean shape. Pick
that for the first fix this iteration.

Order for follow-up cycles:

1. **CITE-002 heading/Keywords** (this iter, ~3 FPs) — done.
2. **CITE-002 `\citep[...]` optarg** (~12 FPs) — extend ancestor walk.
3. **CITE-002 bibitem + base-R + wrappers** (~11 FPs) — add masks.
4. **CAP-002 hyphenated proper names** (~6 FPs) — allowlist + hyphen-aware.
5. **MARKUP-002 already-wrapped + code blocks** (~6 FPs) — mask logic.
6. **MARKUP-001 single-letter** (~89 FPs) — biggest payoff but also
   highest risk; defer until smaller fixes have shrunk noise.

The single-FP rules (NAME-001, BIBTEX-003, OPER-001/004, PRE-003,
TYPO-001) are tracked in todo #37 as a sweep-pass once the bigger
clusters are closed.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed by iteration 15. Headings/Keywords fix landed:

- **JSS-CITE-002** (full): tp 163 → 161 (−2), fp 29 → 27 (−2),
  precision **84.90% → 85.64% (+0.74pp)** — still FAIL.
- **JSS-CITE-002** (pinned): tp 53 → 52 (−1), fp 26 → 24 (−2),
  precision **67.09% → 68.42% (+1.33pp)** — still FAIL.
- **5 orphans** dropped: 3 confirmed FPs in headings/Keywords
  (dtwclust:1808, plot3logit:88, spacetime:1263), 2 mislabeled TPs
  in `\Keywords{}` (ggmcmc:38, lifecontingencies/mortality_projection:40)
  that were really FPs.
- **1 new violation surfaced** at ggmcmc/v70i09.Rnw:76 — `\pkg{ggmcmc}`
  in §1 body without same-paragraph `\citep`. Previously masked because
  the `\Keywords{}` mention exhausted the `seen` set; the new fix lets
  the body mention through. Labeled FP after the fact (citation lives
  in `\Abstract{}`); recorded as a new sub-cluster (todo #39:
  abstract-cite-coverage).

Most of the iter-14 plan remains open — see iter-15 Findings/Plan
for the full catalogue.

### Findings / suggestions

A full sweep of the labelled FPs across every rule with at least
one FP. Clusters surfaced for each rule, ranked by potential
FP-elimination volume.

**JSS-CITE-002** — 27 FPs split into 6 sub-clusters (only one
addressed this iter):

| sub-cluster | fp | sketch |
|---|---:|---|
| `\citep[...]` / `\citealp[...]` optional arg | ~12 | cite is ancestor of `\pkg{}`, not sibling — extend ancestor walk |
| `\mbox{}` / `\caption{}` / list `\item{}` wrappers | ~5 | wrapper macro hides cite from sibling check |
| `\bibitem` / `thebibliography` | ~3 | bib entry IS the citation — add to no-cite zone |
| base-R packages (parallel, methods, stats) | ~3 | ship with R; allowlist |
| `\footnote{}` cite-in-footnote | ~2 | cite + pkg both in footnote arg group |
| abstract-cite-coverage (ggmcmc:76) | ~1 | abstract has both `\pkg{X}` and `\citep{}` but body mention still flagged |

**JSS-MARKUP-001** — 89 FPs, biggest single source:

- single-letter `R`/`C` ambiguity (~50): math symbol, name initial,
  `.r` filename, version-string segment
- inside `\bibitem` (subset of above; ~10 in GPareto bibliography)

**JSS-REFS-003** — 53 FPs, two policy questions:

- DOI present but rule fires anyway (~12) — bib-field detection bug
- "advisory rule, missing DOI not a violation" (~10) — severity question

**JSS-CAP-003** — 29 FPs, precision 38.3%:

- "off by 2" line-number cluster + `\caption{}` sentence-style misfires
  at column 1 (~21 empty-reason rows likely the same cluster)

**JSS-CAP-002** — 21 FPs:

- hyphenated proper names (Hardy-Weinberg, Newey-West, Klein-Spady,
  Robert Koch) — second-word capitalisation rule trips compound nouns

**JSS-MARKUP-002** — 19 FPs:

- false-fire when `\pkg{}` already wraps (~6)
- inside code blocks (~3)
- ambiguous identifiers (sandwich-as-method, ggplot2 in code) (~3)

**JSS-NAME-002** — 10 FPs:

- publisher-canonicalization heuristic disagrees with corpus
  (Springer vs Springer-Verlag remnants from reverted commit)

**JSS-MARKUP-004** — 10 FPs:

- `\dots`, `\&`, `\.`, accents treated as markup needing plain-text shim
- `\subsection`/`\subsubsection` not handled by the `\section[plain]{markup}` check

**JSS-CODE-003** — 9 FPs:

- code samples without operators or commas (bare identifiers)

**JSS-XREF-002** — 9 FPs:

- equation-ref check fires on section/model refs (`sec:summary`, `mod:cox`)

**JSS-MARKUP-003** — 9 FPs:

- rule fires inside Schunk / Code blocks / verbatim envs

**JSS-TYPO-004** — 7 FPs:

- caption-position rule enforces single direction; JSS style is
  table-captions-above + figure-captions-below

**JSS-OPER-002** — 7 FPs:

- `T` as upper bound of `\sum_{t=1}^T` etc. mistaken for transpose

**Smaller clusters** (1–5 FPs each), tracked individually:

- JSS-PARSE-000 (5, noisy parse errors), JSS-PRE-007 (5, accents in
  `\author{}`), JSS-REFS-006 (5, leading `\pkg{}:` titles), JSS-CAP-004
  (4, multi-line Keywords), JSS-STRUCT-001 (4, Discussion as summary),
  JSS-REFS-004 (4, title markup detection), JSS-HOUSE-001 (4, e.g./i.e.
  regex), JSS-CAP-001 (3, mislabeled-package), JSS-PRE-002 (3, missing
  preamble macros), JSS-BIBTEX-004 (3, fires at definition site),
  JSS-XREF-001 (3, cross-paper refs), JSS-XREF-004 (3, subequations),
  JSS-OPER-003 (2, code-chunk paragraph break), JSS-HOUSE-003 (2,
  package allowlist), and 6 single-FP rules swept together.

Catalogued in `TaskList` as todos #4-#37, #39 (#38 was the
post-fix human-review of the new ggmcmc:76 violation, completed).

### Plan

The 27 CITE-002 FPs split cleanly. After this iter's heading/Keywords
fix (3 FPs), the next CITE-002 cycle should tackle the
`\citep[...]` optarg cluster (~12 FPs, mechanical) — that alone takes
CITE-002 from 24 → ~12 FPs and likely flips it to PASS.

Recommended attack order across rules (bigger-first within similar
risk tiers):

1. **JSS-CITE-002 cite-optarg** (todo #4) — ~12 FPs, mechanical extension of the existing rule.
2. **JSS-CITE-002 bibitem + base-R + abstract-coverage** (todos #5, #6, #39) — ~7 FPs, all add-to-mask-list shape.
3. **JSS-MARKUP-002 already-wrapped + code-block context** (todo #15) — ~9 FPs, simple skip-already-wrapped check.
4. **JSS-MARKUP-003 code-block context** (todo #16) — ~5 FPs, share env-list with #15.
5. **JSS-CAP-002 hyphenated proper names** (todo #10) — ~6 FPs, allowlist or hyphen-aware capitalisation.
6. **JSS-XREF-002 equation-only restriction** (todo #18) — ~7 FPs, label-prefix filter.
7. **JSS-OPER-002 T-as-bound disambiguation** (todo #19) — ~7 FPs, math-context inspection.
8. **JSS-TYPO-004 caption-position branching** (todo #20) — 7 FPs, simple env-name branch.
9. **JSS-REFS-003 DOI presence detection** (todo #13) — ~12 FPs, bib-field parsing audit.
10. **JSS-CAP-003 line-offset bug + caption-style** (todo #9) — ~29 FPs but needs investigation; do after smaller wins.
11. **JSS-MARKUP-001 single-letter ambiguity** (todos #11, #12) — ~89 FPs, biggest payoff but highest regression risk; tackle after the smaller, cleaner rules have stabilised.

Smaller-cluster sweeps (todos #17, #22-#37) bundled into a single
"single-FP investigations" pass once the volume rules above have closed.

### Results (post-implementation)

Closed across iterations 16-35 (corpus pinned at 98 papers; FAIL
count dropped from 15 → 3, PASS count from 35 → 47).

**Iter-14 → iter-35 deltas (full corpus):**

- Total TP: 4090 → 3935 (−155); total FP: 352 → 248 (−104).
- Most TPs lost are mislabels of two kinds: (a) labelers applying
  rules to non-jss / `[nojss]` documents where the rule's intent
  doesn't reach (PRE-003 −24, PRE-007 −23, HOUSE-003 −31, XREF-002
  −23), and (b) AI/migrated labels with stale or hallucinated
  reasoning (NAME-002 +10/−10 net flip, MARKUP-004 −14, BIBTEX-004
  −3 flips).
- Real new violations surfaced and labelled this round: 1
  (ggmcmc:76 CITE-002 in §1 body without same-paragraph cite,
  initially flagged by the iter-15 fix and labelled FP after the
  abstract-cite-coverage rule extension).

**Rules deliberately not closed (see iter-15 Plan #15, #20, plus #9
left FAILing):**

- JSS-MARKUP-002 (#15) — own-package noun usage cluster is too
  entangled with labeler convention; first attempt at a skip-list
  dropped 191 labelled TPs across xts/zoo/sandwich vignettes.
- JSS-TYPO-004 (#20) — table caption-above-content vs figure
  caption-below-content split: corpus labelers consistently flag
  the table case as TP, contradicting both my reading of JSS style
  and a clean rule fix.
- JSS-CAP-003 (#9) — got 2 incremental fixes (numbered-list
  boundary stub, geographic/microbe proper-noun extensions) for a
  combined 47% precision; remaining 19 FPs are diverse minor
  patterns ("X and Y" two-author runs, mixed-case continuations,
  paper-specific phrasings) without a clean cluster.
- JSS-CAP-004 (#25) — tried hyphenated-compound + abbreviation
  exemption; labelers flag Q-Q / Kaplan-Meier / ANOVA as TP while
  flagging Bayesian / MCMC / GARCH as FP on the same code path,
  reverted.

**Skip-list change:** added JSS-NAME-002 to
`eval/review-skip-list.toml` so the AI classifier no longer
auto-labels publisher canonicalisation cases — the model
hallucinates JSS conventions on them.

**Memory note:** dropped (and re-added) the Springer →
Springer-Verlag canonical mapping twice over the project's history.
Saved a `feedback_jss_publisher_canonical.md` memory entry to break
the cycle: bare publisher mappings are JSS canon, not labeler noise.

Next iteration starts by growing the corpus (the 16-paper expansion
in iter-14 is overdue for a follow-up).

## Iteration 16 — 2026-04-28T20:00:39Z — post-JSS-CITE-002-cite-optarg

- **Corpus size:** 98 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=23, pinned=19

### Findings / suggestions

**Convergence reached.** This snapshot closes the autonomous-loop
phase. 53 of 54 catalogued JSS rules pass the precision threshold
on the 232-paper corpus; only `JSS-CAP-003` remains FAIL after
five consecutive fix attempts (38.0 % → 60.6 %). The five rounds
exhausted the tractable FP clusters (eponym whitelist, cross-ref
nouns, textual citations, label-prefix captions); the remaining
13 FPs are domain-ontology gaps — statistical method names like
*Huber's Proposal 2*, R class names like *DSClassify*, place
names, political proper nouns — that whack-a-mole patching would
only silence at the cost of recall.

The CRAN-vignette corpus is also effectively exhausted: of the
1 177 JSS-paper-counterpart candidate packages (JSS archive ∪
CRAN-GitHub), 232 are pinned, 496 are off-CRAN (archived), and the
476 currently on CRAN no longer ship JSS-counterpart vignettes
(53 % ship no vignette at all; the rest ship vignettes that don't
cite JSS). Non-R JSS papers (~115 across Python/MATLAB/Stata/Julia/
C++) have no JSS-hosted .tex source — only PDFs and code/data
archives.

### Plan

Hand off `JSS-CAP-003` to a human reviewer. Two options:

1. **Tighten the whitelist by category** — extend `_PROPER_NOUNS`
   with a curated statistics-vocabulary list and add an
   R-class-name detector (`[A-Z][a-z]+[A-Z]\w*` with ≥1 internal
   upper).
2. **Lower the rule's confidence** — accept that captions with
   embedded proper-noun runs are inherently ambiguous, downgrade
   to `severity=warning`, and surface the call to the author.

Both require human judgement; the autonomous loop has done all it
can without overfitting.

### Results (post-implementation)

Loop converged at iter 78 (overall precision 96.79 %, +0.91pp over
iters 67–78). 226/226 recall plants still fire after the rule
changes. The cron-driven 5-hour iteration trigger has been
cancelled and the iteration lock cleared.

---

## Conclusion (closing the autonomous loop, 2026-05-03)

This log is closed. 78 iterations across the precision-loop
methodology — six weeks of corpus growth, AI-classifier review,
human verification, and rule-by-rule fix attempts — have brought
the JSS lint catalogue from a 50-paper baseline (Iter 1) to a
**232-paper, 53/54 PASS, 96.79 % overall-precision** state. What
follows is a stable artefact: a linter whose remaining error budget
is concentrated in one rule and one corpus boundary, both of
which are out of reach of further mechanical iteration.

### Where the wins came from

The bulk of the precision gains came from three categories of
intervention:

1. **Mass FP elimination via targeted exemptions.** MARKUP-001 lost
   ~100 FPs to language-name + filename detection (iters 14, 26).
   REFS-003 lost 60+ FPs to abbreviation-aware matching. CITE-002
   lost the textual-citation cluster. Each was a domain pattern
   the rule's original author hadn't anticipated and that fresh
   corpus exposure surfaced.
2. **Per-rule labeller routing.** The full 934-row gold benchmark
   (iter 71) showed Bonsai-8B and Qwen3-30B are *complementary*,
   not redundant — Bonsai dominates short-prose rules (CAP-002,
   OPER-002), Qwen3 dominates long-prose rules (MARKUP-001,
   CITE-002). Pinning each rule to its best-performing model
   (`eval/review-routing.toml`) cut the human-review queue by ~40 %
   and made the AI-labelled rows trustworthy enough to drive the
   loop unattended.
3. **AI-mislabel correction.** A surprising fraction of "FPs"
   surfaced by the loop were AI-labeller mistakes, not rule
   defects. NAME-001 (FORTRAN→Fortran), TYPO-004 (caption-before-
   chunk-content), HOUSE-003 (`\usepackage{hyperref}` over
   jss.cls), BIBTEX-004 (6+-author entries), and PARSE-000 (real
   Latin-1 byte) were all correctly fired; the labellers
   misidentified them. Proxy-flipping these as `human:claude-proxy`
   added ~14 TPs without rule changes.

### What's deferred

Two open items survive convergence:

1. **JSS-CAP-003 at 60.6 %** (20 TP / 13 FP, 5/5 attempts used).
   The remaining 13 FPs split across statistical method names
   (*Huber's Proposal 2*), R class identifiers (*DSClassify*,
   *DSOutlier*), place names (*Long Bridge*, *Wind Field Park*,
   *Québec*), and political proper nouns. Each is a domain-
   ontology gap, not a parse / heuristic gap. Two paths forward
   are documented in the iter-78 Plan section.

2. **Non-R JSS-paper corpus.** ~115 JSS papers in Python, MATLAB,
   Stata, Julia, C++, etc., all written in jss.cls, are
   inaccessible via the current CRAN-vignette path. JSS itself
   doesn't host the manuscript .tex source — only the PDF and
   replication code/data. Hand-curating the .tex from author
   GitHubs / arXiv would extend the corpus into multi-language
   territory but isn't loop-tractable.

### What this log doesn't capture

The git history under `src/texlint/journals/jss/rules/`
documents *what* the rule changes were. This log documents
*why* — the corpus signals that motivated each change and the
TP/FP deltas that confirmed (or reverted) them. Read the two
together: the diff says what shipped, this log says what evidence
shipped it.

The infrastructure built along the way (the
`eval-jss iterate plan` decider, the policy-codified
`eval/iteration-policy.toml`, the per-rule labeller routing, the
recall-plants test suite, the pre-commit guard chained into
`.githooks/pre-commit`) outlives this log. Future
human-driven iterations can replay any step of the loop without
the historical context that produced these knobs.

### Resuming

The loop can be resumed at any time:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
eval-jss iterate plan        # what should we do next?
eval-jss iterate refresh     # re-scan + restore labels
eval-jss iterate record <label>
```

The planner correctly emits `deferred_rules` for the CAP-003
state; once that rule is hand-fixed (or downgraded to `warning`
severity), the planner will report `stop` with "all rules pass".
Until then, the answer is structurally `grow_corpus`, and the
corpus is structurally exhausted by the means available.

## Iteration 79 — 2026-06-12T19:36:06Z — post-showstopper-fix-batch

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=148, pinned=115

**Note:** Parser leniency batch (macro-def bodies, tolerant retry, latin-1, Rmd fence, bib dup fields, YAML frontmatter): corpus scan_failed 51 -> 1. MARKUP-001 context guards: labelled-set precision 0.912 -> 0.940, recall plants unchanged. CAP-003 demoted to info; default fail-on now warning.

## Iteration 80 — 2026-06-12T19:55:18Z — label-consistency-pass

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=148, pinned=115

**Note:** Reconciled conflicting labels on identical/equivalent sites: 3 flips to FP by human adjudication (human label wins over AI on the same line), 14 guard-class TPs flipped to FP (sites silenced by the adjudicated MARKUP-001 guards), 5 CRAN-expansion FPs flipped to TP (recall-corpus ground truth), 31 AI-vs-AI contradictions reset to pending for re-review (mostly stale PARSE-000 and REFS-003 doi-advisory rows). Zero exact-line conflicts remain.

## Iteration 83 — 2026-06-14T05:33:47Z — cap003-strict-recheck

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=73, pinned=57

**Note:** CAP-003 double-check: built reusable eval-jss cap003-recheck (deterministic caption extraction + per-word analysis; frontier-judge rubric; human-label validation). Strict 2+-offender ruling applied: relabeled to 11 TP / 45 FP (judge-vs-human 65%, all disagreements prior-TP/judge-FP = single-stray-capital boundary). Shipped CamelCase/digit identifier exclusion (19.6%->22.0% precision; recall plants unchanged). Residual FPs are bare-eponym/named-term gazetteer gaps (documented intractable); CAP-003 stays info/advisory.

## Iteration 84 — 2026-06-14T08:42:21Z — by-documentclass-dimension

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=73, pinned=57

**Note:** Added papers.doc_class + report --by-class. Audited corpus: 214 jss / 22 non-jss / 3 unknown. Precision is document-class-independent: jss 94.08%, non-jss 95.02%, overall 94.26% — article-class CRAN vignettes of JSS papers (lme4, car, clValid...) are a robustness check, not a confound. Kept all papers per user decision; headline = jss-class.

## Iteration 85 — 2026-06-14T08:55:47Z — rnw-commented-chunk-anchor

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=38, pinned=33

**Note:** Fixed _RNW_CHUNK to anchor chunk headers at column 0 (Sweave/knitr requirement). A commented-out chunk header (% # <<...>>=) was opening phantom chunks that swallowed real LaTeX prose and blanked its markup, causing spurious MARKUP findings + parse failures. Impact: tolerant-parsed papers 60->32 (28 recovered to clean parse); MARKUP-001 74.3->79.6%, MARKUP-003 87->88.5%, aggregate 94.26->95.17%. Recall 0.775->0.779. Also added MARKUP-003 source-level guard against flagging already-\code-wrapped function calls on degraded parses.

## Iteration 86 — 2026-06-14T09:05:17Z — rnw-indent-and-option-sentinels

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=38, pinned=33

**Note:** Fixed chunk-anchor regression (allow indented knitr chunk headers ^[ \t]*<< + indented @ terminator) and added MARKUP-003 option-value guard (skip TRUE/FALSE/NA/NULL as RHS of key=value, e.g. includegraphics[clip=TRUE]). MARKUP-003 88.5->91.3% (now PASSES 90% threshold; FP 208->142), aggregate 95.17->95.53%. Recall steady 0.779.

## Iteration 87 — 2026-06-14T09:52:04Z — markup003-custom-code-wrappers

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=38, pinned=33

**Note:** L559 \cmd{TRUE} labeled FP. Rule fix: _custom_code_wrapper_macros detects paper-defined inline-code wrappers (\def\cmd{\lstinline...}, \newcommand{\cmdtxt}[1]{\texttt{#1}}); MARKUP-003 function-call+sentinel detectors skip tokens inside their uses. 29 \cmd-wrapper FPs across interp tri/partDeriv/interp vignettes (AI had mislabeled them TP) now go stale/excluded. MARKUP-003 89.54->91.50% (honest, passes); aggregate 95.56%. Wrapper DEFINITIONS still flagged (def-body \texttt->\code = TP).

## Iteration 88 — 2026-06-14T10:01:52Z — rnw-chunk-trailing-ws

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=34, pinned=29

**Note:** Pre-existing bug: _RNW_CHUNK required >>= immediately before newline, but Sweave/knitr allow trailing whitespace (18 corpus .Rnw files). Unrecognised echo=FALSE chunks weren't blanked -> hidden R code leaked into prose (multcomp generalsiminf.Rnw:924 'attr(K,"contrasts")<-NULL' flagged MARKUP-003). Allow >>=[ \t]*. MARKUP-003 91.5->91.7%, aggregate 95.58%, recall 0.779.

## Iteration 89 — 2026-06-14T10:53:04Z — rnw-chunk-regex-audit

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=33, pinned=28

**Note:** Focused chunk-regex audit: fixed A2 (@ <text>/@ %def terminators were over-running, 33 files) and A1 (> in chunk options unrecognised, 3 files). Tolerant-parsed papers 32->29; aggregate 95.58->95.60%. Documented limitations: A3 global opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE) not simulated (20 files), A4 \Sexpr nested-brace/multiline (6), A5 <<>>= inside verbatim wrongly wrapped (3, low lint impact).

## Iteration 90 — 2026-06-14T11:15:31Z — rnw-global-chunk-opts-A3

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=33, pinned=28

**Note:** A3: honour document-global \SweaveOpts/opts_chunk$set echo/include defaults (overridable per chunk). ~20 vignettes hide all code globally; their code is now blanked instead of wrapped+linted. Removed ~100+ findings on never-rendered code (CODE-003 -105, WIDTH-001 -93 incl some questionably-TP-labeled). Aggregate 95.60->95.56 (correct: stop linting hidden code), recall steady 0.779, no regressions (CODE-001/002 100%, MARKUP-003 91.9% pass). Limitation: nested parens before echo= in opts_chunk$set can truncate the scan.

## Iteration 91 — 2026-06-14T11:24:03Z — markup003-index-invisible

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=33, pinned=28

**Note:** MARKUP-003 skips \texttt/funccall/sentinel inside \index{} and nomenclature/glossary (non-rendered macros). sets.Rnw:83/84 (\index{\texttt{#1}} in \codefunind def) no longer fire. Narrow invisible-macro set (not _META_MACROS) so def-body \texttt code wrappers stay TP. Recall 0.779, no regressions.

## Iteration 92 — 2026-06-14T11:48:04Z — markup003-fp-audit-guards

- **Corpus size:** 239 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=26, pinned=22

**Note:** MARKUP-003 FP audit: analysed all 143 FPs (124 texttt-over-suggestion, 15 sentinel, 4 funccall). Fixed 7 clean classes: commented verbatim envs (parser), \texttt of email/URL/DOI/numeric-label, algorithm-float pseudocode, plain caption/section short-arg, possessive sentinels. ~35 FPs removed; MARKUP-003 91.3->93.61%, aggregate 95.58->95.76%, recall 0.779. Left the ~100 ambiguous \texttt-of-word/quoted-string FPs as the documented precision ceiling.

## Iteration 97 — 2026-07-04T20:54:33Z — post-review-citation-fix

- **Corpus size:** 244 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=19, pinned=15

**Note:** Closing state: human review complete (0 pending), citation-key MARKUP-001 fix applied (skip {key} args, keep [optional] prose). Overall precision 96.33%; recall 0.792. Only MARKUP-001 fails (84.67%) on genuine residual FPs (math/algorithm C, cna/causal C-component/C-consistency/C-coverage, R^2) — citation-key class cleared. OPER-002 98.8% (Tornqvist exclusion). Fixable next: math/algorithm-C guard for MARKUP-001.

## Iteration 98 — 2026-07-04T21:06:39Z — post-markup001-mislabels

- **Corpus size:** 244 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=19, pinned=15

**Note:** Corrected 22 MARKUP-001 FP->TP mislabels found in human review (R package/function/code, R versions, Base R, C-or-Fortran). MARKUP-001 84.67% -> 86.33% (1143 TP / 181 FP). Remaining FPs are inherent single-letter/domain-compound ambiguity. Overall precision essentially unchanged.

## Iteration 99 — 2026-07-04T21:46:25Z — post-nonr-corpus

- **Corpus size:** 246 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Added 2 non-R JSS papers to the precision corpus for cross-language external validity (github manifest rows + corpus fetch): DNest4 (C++/Python, jss.v086.i07, eggplantbren/DNest4) and citest (Python+R, MIDASverse/citest, in-press). Corpus 244->246. main's merged parser resolved DNest4's earlier PARSE-000. Full re-scan = run 236 (246 papers, 22587 violations). Reviewed all 79 new violations: LLM-routed labeller (70 labelled, 9 uncertain) + Opus 4.8 source-level adjudication of the 9 uncertain and 3 FP-flagged rows. Verdicts: DNest4 36 TP / 0 FP (1.000); citest 38 TP / 5 FP (0.884). Discovered a real CODE-003 bug: it scans CodeOutput blocks and misreads hyphens in program-output words (p-value, R-squared) as bare subtraction operators -> 4 FPs on citest; corpus-wide CODE-003 still 99.12% (2362 TP / 21 FP). Overall live precision 96.44% (18681 TP / 690 FP, 0 pending).

## Iteration 100 — 2026-07-05T04:59:35Z — post-code003-output-scope

- **Corpus size:** 246 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Fixed CODE-003 (and CODE-001/002) scanning program-output envs. CODE_DISPLAY_ENVS split: new CODE_INPUT_ENVS excludes CodeOutput/Soutput; code-STYLE rules (CODE-001/002/003) now scan authored-code (input) envs only, while WIDTH-001 keeps the full set (output lines must still fit the column limit). Program output is verbatim tool output — you cannot restyle what R printed, and CODE-003's auto-fix would corrupt it. Removed 67 output-env CODE-003 firings (misread hyphens in p-value/R-squared, k=4 summary lines, matrix dumps, regression tables) + 6 CODE-001 output-comment firings. CODE-003 99.12%->99.35% (2301 TP / 15 FP); CODE-001 stays 100% (439 TP). Overall live precision 96.46% (18614 TP / 684 FP, 0 pending), run 237. Regression tests added (CodeOutput + Soutput silent). Pre-existing: 4 SARIF golden byte-equality tests fail on stale rule count (62 vs 61 from the main merge) — unrelated to this fix.

## Iteration 101 — 2026-07-05T06:24:33Z — post-nonr-corpus-expansion

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Expanded non-R precision corpus 5->14 via authenticated GitHub code search (targeted proglang{Python/Julia/MATLAB/C++} queries in jss-class .tex). Added 9 papers: pymc2 (Python, pymc-devs GP module), pymcmc (Python), factorlasso (Python, in-prep), evomap (Python), skaters (Python), topica (Python), adlogit (R+Python dual), zebendelib (Python/Zig), stochbb (C++). Rejected: fbooja/lionfish (jdssv/ajs = wrong journals), vop_poc_nz (plain article class), mlpy (JSS template demo), matthew-brett/pymc (stub). Full re-scan run 239 (255 papers). All ~700 new violations reviewed via routed LLM labeller; 54 uncertain/FP-flagged rows adjudicated at source by Opus 4.8 (35 TP / 19 FP). Overall live precision 96.48% (19275 TP / 703 FP, 0 pending). REGRESSION: CITE-002 90.56%->89.02% (FAIL) — the Python papers' install-guide sections expose CITE-002 over-firing on \pkg{} build/OS tooling listed with download URLs (mingw/msys/gfortran/gcc/pyreadline), mis-wrapped language names (\pkg{Python}), hardware (\pkg{EPYC}), and passing ecosystem name-drops. Two linter bugs surfaced (not yet fixed): (1) XREF-004 fails to match \ref when a \label contains an embedded source newline (pymcmc eq:observation/eq:prior) -> 2 FPs; (2) CITE-002 install-guide over-firing above. CODE-003 99.26%, BIBTEX-004 100%, NAME-002 98.96% hold.

## Iteration 102 — 2026-07-05T07:58:39Z — post-cite002-xref004-fixes

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Fixed the two bugs surfaced by the non-R corpus expansion, recovering the precision gate. (1) XREF-004: normalise internal whitespace in \label/\ref keys so a label wrapped across a source newline (TeX folds newline+indent to one space) matches its \ref — pymcmc eq:observation/eq:prior/random-walk were false 'unreferenced' hits. XREF-004 recall stays 1.000. (2) CITE-002: skip \pkg{} of known language names (\pkg{Python}=markup misuse, not a citeable package), and accept a URL directly adjacent to the package (\pkg{mingw} (http://...), \pkg{GPy}: \url{...}) as satisfying the citation — JSS allows URL references for software without a paper. Adjacency-checked (URL before first sentence break, within 60 chars) so a distant URL for something else (romc's Colab \href, factorlasso pyarrow) still fires. CITE-002 89.02%->90.85% (288 TP/29 FP, PASS). All 7 rows that stopped firing verified correct (language misuse, adjacent-URL references, or genuinely-referenced equations); no false negatives; recall aggregate holds 0.792. Regenerated 4 SARIF byte-equality goldens (masked catalogue rule count 62->61, stale since the main merge). Full suite 1764 passed. Overall live precision 96.52% (19268 TP/694 FP, 0 pending); only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT remains. Branch is merge-ready.

## Iteration 103 — 2026-07-05T09:08:18Z — post-xref005-lstlisting

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Extended XREF-005 to code-listing floats (lstlisting), closing the recall gap the non-R corpus exposed. XREF-005 previously only scanned figure/table envs with \label{}/\caption{} macros; trueskill (and JSS Python papers generally) present captioned code via \begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:x,caption={...}] whose label/caption are package OPTIONS, not macros -> the rule structurally missed them (recall 0.158, 16 FN). Added _LISTING_FLOAT_ENVS={lstlisting} + brace-aware option parsing (_lstlisting_option_block / _lstlisting_caption_and_labels): a captioned listing is a numbered float and must be referenced; uncaptioned = inline snippet (skipped); captioned+no-label or captioned+labeled+unreferenced -> fire. Option parsing is brace-aware so a comma/] inside caption={...} doesn't truncate, and only the [...] block is read (body 'caption=' text ignored). Results: XREF-005 recall 0.158 -> 1.000 (19/19); precision 99.08% -> 99.58% (236 TP/1 FP) after labelling 20 new trueskill listing firings TP (all verified 0-ref or no-label). Also corrected a trueskill annotation off-by-one (1685 \end{paracol} -> 1686 \begin{lstlisting}). Recall aggregate 0.792 -> 0.800. Overall precision 96.53%, full suite 1770 passed, only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT. Remaining 1 XREF-005 FP is the deferred robustbase Rnw-parser dropped-\ref edge case (separate).

## Iteration 104 — 2026-07-05T10:10:51Z — post-width001-trailing-ws

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** WIDTH-001: measure visible (rstrip) width so trailing whitespace doesn't count. Investigation found the rule's 92.0% precision was two separate issues: (1) a genuine FP class — 29 firings on lines of exactly 80 visible columns plus a stray trailing space (raw 81), which don't visibly overflow (CARBayes, DAKS CodeInput); fixed by rstrip-ing before the length check (removes those 29, no genuine TP lost, WIDTH-001 recall unchanged 0.684). (2) 44 mislabels — genuinely-wide lines (rstrip 81-119, mostly RcppDE C++ comment banners / aligned trailing comments and cran_network) that ai:bonsai wrongly labelled 'code fits'; WIDTH-001 is a deterministic length check and bonsai cannot reliably count columns. Re-adjudicated all 44 to TP (each verified rstrip>80). WIDTH-001 92.0% -> 100.00% (519 TP / 0 FP). Overall live precision 96.53% -> 96.75% (19304 TP / 649 FP, 0 pending). Full suite 1773 passed. Note: WIDTH-001 is mechanically decidable; it should be auto-labelled (len>limit) rather than sent to an LLM reviewer -- the default routing to bonsai was the sole precision drag. Only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT remains.

## Iteration 105 — 2026-07-05T10:38:37Z — post-oper004-p-function

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** OPER-004: don't flag a bare P(...) that is a function, transition-probability matrix, or CDF rather than the probability operator. Subagent mapped 26 FPs into three clusters; only the transition-matrix + CDF P-literal cluster is cleanly fixable. Gate the _LITERAL_PROB_RE emission: suppress a bare P(...) only when (a) the document reserves a real probability glyph (flag_pr = doc uses \Prob) AND (b) the balanced argument carries no relational/event token (=,<,>,|,\le,\ge,\in,\mid,\vert). So P(t_0,t) transition matrix and P(x) CDF in \Prob-using docs are suppressed, while P(X>x) / P(A|B) (relation) and bare P in docs with no \Prob reservation still fire. Empirically verified via re-scan: removed 6 FPs (flexsurv 422/427/431, poweRlaw 171/173/200) AND 3 rows that were mislabelled TP but are the same non-probability class (flexsurv 428 P(t_0,t_0)=I matrix, 478 P(t_0,t) matrix, poweRlaw 202 'P(x) are the CDFs') -> gold-set consistency improved; zero genuine probability suppressed. Neither paper is in the recall corpus; OPER-004 recall unchanged 0.603, aggregate 0.800. OPER-004 95.6% -> 96.58% (564 TP / 20 FP). Overall precision 96.75% -> 96.78%. Full suite 1777 passed; ruff clean. Residual 20 FPs (causaleffect P(v_i|...), \mathbf{E} residual matrices, \newcommand alias def-sites) are inherent notation ambiguity the subagent verified every gate loses TPs on -- deferred. Only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT.

## Iteration 106 — 2026-07-05T12:32:33Z — post-markup003-code-redef

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** MARKUP-003: don't flag \texttt inside a (re)definition of \code / \pkg / \proglang itself. Subagent mapped 128 FPs into clusters; only the '\texttt is the body of a \code redefinition' cluster is cleanly fixable (the 91-FP non-code-word cluster has no syntactic signal separating \texttt{global} from \texttt{glm}; the 12-FP path/filename cluster is net-negative, killing ~21 path-shaped TPs). Authors add \newcommand{\code}[1]{\texttt{#1}} as a jss.cls fallback; that \texttt IS \code's body, so rewriting to \code is circular -> FP. Added _is_code_macro_redefinition guard (line-scoped regex matching \(re)newcommand/providecommand/def of \code|\pkg|\proglang). NARROW: defining a NEW wrapper (\Rcmd, \cmdtxt) still fires (the existing def-body-is-TP behaviour that protects ~97 TPs is preserved -- verified \Rcmd still flags 1, \code-redef flags 0). Empirically verified via re-scan: removed 8 FPs (effects, laeken, lme4, surveillance, skaters) AND 10 rows mislabelled TP that are the identical \newcommand{\code}{\texttt} defect (car, laeken:16, mvtnorm, robustbase x4, tram, gramEvol) -> gold-set consistency (laeken:14 FP vs laeken:16 TP were the same construct). Zero genuine TP lost; MARKUP-003 recall unchanged 0.596; bad fixture still fires. MARKUP-003 93.29% -> 93.65% (1770 TP / 120 FP). Overall precision 96.78% -> 96.81%. Full suite 1781 passed. Residual ~91 non-code-word + ~12 path FPs are inherent (no clean signal) -- deferred. Only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT.

## Iteration 107 — 2026-07-05T13:32:18Z — post-xref004-readjudicate

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** XREF-004: re-adjudicated 35 mislabelled FPs -> TP; no code change (the rule is correct). Investigation: all 35 FPs are numbered equations that are either unlabelled (case a) or carry a label never \ref-ed anywhere in the paper (case b) -- both are genuine violations per the recall-corpus definition, which plants EXACTLY these (comments: 'Equation with neither \label nor \nonumber' and '\label{X} exists but is never \ref-ed from the text'). Proof of mislabel: HardyWeinberg eq:chisq1/eq:chisq2 are planted as XREF-004 violations in the recall corpus yet were labelled false_positive on the precision side. Verified programmatically: rule still fires on 34/35 (numbering/\nonumber logic correct -- dtw fires on the labelled row, not the \nonumber row); broad cross-file \...ref search found 0 of the 35 labels referenced (0 genuine ref-detection misses). ai:bonsai systematically mislabels labelled-but-unreferenced equations as FP (hallucinates a reference or assumes a label suffices) -- same labeler-noise pattern as WIDTH-001. XREF-004 96.54% -> 100.00% (1013 TP / 0 FP). Overall live precision 96.81% -> 96.99%. Recall unchanged (XREF-004 recall already 1.000). Only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT remains.

## Iteration 108 — 2026-07-05T14:33:35Z — post-eval-sweep-untouched

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Multi-agent workflow sweep of 12 untouched rules (76 live FPs). Each rule investigated + adversarially verified in parallel; classified FPs as mislabel / genuine-FP / fixable. Actions: (1) Re-adjudicated 41 verifier-CONFIRMED mislabels -> TP across REFS-006(15), MARKUP-002(8), CAP-002(6), STRUCT-001/REFS-005/NAME-002/HOUSE-001(2 each), XREF-001/XREF-006/OPER-001/MARKUP-004(1 each) -- all genuine violations bonsai mislabeled (e.g. CAP-002 sentence-case section titles, MARKUP-002 bare 'ggplot2', REFS-006 sentence-case bib titles). (2) Three code fixes: REFS-006 add 'about'/'around' to title stop-words (NOT 'under' -- mlt plant caps it); REFS-004 strip brace-less control words in _title_mentions_unwrapped so \R (author \proglang{R} macro) is not mis-detected as unwrapped R; MARKUP-002 sandwich-token guards (preceding 'of the', markdown-emphasis strip, cross-newline follower, verb 'any'). Fixes removed the target FPs PLUS 18 more rows mislabelled TP of the same classes (all verified: \R-macro refs, 'about' over-cap, 'of the sandwich' metaphor -- zero genuine TP lost, recall aggregate unchanged 0.800). Caught+fixed a whitespace-set bug in the sandwich guard (dropped newline from lstrip -> 2 phantom firings). Deferred: XREF-001 (grandparent-climb AST change, 2 FPs, complex); CAP-002 fix (verifier: risky, proper-noun gazetteer gaps, no safe fix -- 10 genuine FPs left). REFS-006 97.44->98.84%, REFS-004 ->100%, MARKUP-002 94.42->99.59%, plus the small-rule flips. Overall precision 96.81% -> 97.23% (19349 TP/551 FP, 0 pending). Full suite 1802 passed; ruff clean. Only MARKUP-001 EXEMPT remains.

## Iteration 109 — 2026-07-06T15:04:50Z — post-prefreeze-cleanup

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `0.1.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** Pre-freeze cleanup (Tasks 1-3). (1) Recall now excludes retired-rule plants (loaded from catalogue): micro 0.800->0.807, macro 0.868->0.884 (CAP-003 0/16 no longer dragged); retired plants kept in .toml as inert historical record. (2) 32 mechanically-decidable rules flagged deterministic in the catalogue; eval/review.py auto-labels them true_positive (reviewer human:auto-deterministic, excluded from the model gold set) instead of the LLM; prefill_structural unified to the same catalogue source. NO linter behaviour change -- rescan (run 248) produced identical firings (19920). (3) Labeler gold-set benchmark refreshed 2026-07-06 (Bonsai 76.8% on 1576 model-scope rows, deterministic excluded); linter perf benchmark: 255 papers, 67.3s total, median 0.231s / p95 0.662s per manuscript. Precision unchanged 97.23% (19349 TP / 551 FP, 0 pending). FREEZE CONSIDERATIONS: (a) Qwen3 labeler benchmark not refreshed (~7h infeasible); (b) 166/1576 (10.5%) of the model-scope gold set are recent AI-assisted adjudications (human:readjudicate/opus/xref005), not independent human ground truth -- consider excluding before publishing labeler-accuracy claims. No release pin recorded.

### Findings / suggestions

CODE-003 \code{} guard: skip content whose whitespace-separated tokens
are all flag / name / path shaped (`--fix`, `.jss-lint.toml`,
`cargo install jsslint-cli`). FP class surfaced by the project's own
manuscript (documents its CLI): 7 firings there, all FP. Corpus effect:
-6 TP / -0 FP (2415/18 -> 2409/18, 99.3%, PASS). The six stopped-firing
rows were source-audited: five are label debt of the same class the
guard removes (SimInf apt-get/yum install lines, fic quoted warning
message, ordinalgmifs category label, factorlasso pip command); one is
a genuine loss (rootSolve `\code{A x-B}`, a real subtraction) — the
same single-token ambiguity (`a-b`) the rule has always accepted,
now consistently extended to token sequences. Recall re-run: unchanged
(micro 0.807 / macro 0.884, gate green). Rust mirror in jsslint-core
committed alongside; tex_rules_parity covers CODE-003.

### Plan

### Results (post-implementation)

Recorded as iteration 111 itself (post-implementation snapshot).

## Iteration 112 — 2026-07-12T12:08:35Z — post-cap004-keywords

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `1.0.0`
- **Parse failures:** full=20, pinned=16

**Note:** CAP-004 narrowing (review F5): drop the missing-leading-capital branch in both engines; keep only the Title-Case-across-entries defect. The journal's published convention (article.tex) accepts fully-lowercase keyword lists, so \Keywords{robust statistics, R} must not fire. Pure narrowing: removes lowercase-first-keyword firings only; no new pending.

### Delta vs. previous iteration

**Full corpus**

- `JSS-CAP-004`: tp +203→23 (-180), fp +0→0 (+0), pending 0→0 (+0)

**Pinned only**

### Findings / suggestions

Adversarial review (2026-07-12, finding F5) showed CAP-004 was flagging
`\Keywords{}` lists whose only "defect" was a lowercase first keyword —
which is the journal's *published* convention (`article.tex` asks for
sentence case, not a leading capital). Message/example/behaviour
disagreed. The rule is narrowed in both engines to keep only the
Title-Case-across-entries defect (a capitalised non-first word within an
entry); the missing-leading-capital branch and its helpers
(`_keyword_missing_leading_cap`, `_first_keyword_is_markup`, Rust twins)
are removed. Suggestion text updated to match; the violation
message_template is unchanged (part of the eval label key), so no labels
are orphaned. Pure narrowing — only removes firings.

### Plan

Failing tests first (lowercase-first passes; Title Case across entries
still flagged; markup-first still silent), then edit
`capitalization.py` + `rust/.../capitalization.rs` in lockstep, rescan
`examples/ --force`, re-record as iteration 112.

### Results (post-implementation)

CAP-004 full corpus tp 203 -> 23 (-180 TP, 0 FP; pending 0 -> 0);
pinned 154 -> 19. All 180 stopped firings were source-audited as the
intended class: fully-lowercase or markup-first keyword lists with no
Title Case across entries — e.g. HardyWeinberg `ternary plot, Q-Q plot,
chi-square test, ...`; sandwich `covariance matrix estimators,
heteroskedasticity, ...`; betareg `beta regression, rates, proportions,
\proglang{R}`; zoo `totally ordered observations, ...`. The 23
survivors all carry a genuine capitalised non-first word (DBR `Ordinal
Regression`, GPareto `Efficient Global Optimization`, spacetime
`Geographic Information Systems`, synthpop `UK Longitudinal Studies`,
PyMCMC `Metropolis Hastings`). Recall re-run unchanged, gate green — no
CAP-004 recall plant encoded the rejected lowercase-first semantics (all
four plants are Title-Case-across-entries). Rust mirror committed;
`tex_rules_parity` covers CAP-004. Recorded as iteration 112.

**Note:** Enforce capital-after-colon in JSS-CAP-001 (title style) and JSS-CAP-002 (sentence style). 65 new after-colon firings across the corpus (3 CAP-001, 62 CAP-002): 64 TP, 1 FP. Adjudication convention: lowercase prose word after colon = TP; bare lowercase dataset/identifier after colon = TP (should be capitalised or markup-wrapped); the sole FP is 'useR!' (proper-noun conference/brand). Mid-loop FP-class fix: extended the after-colon markup exemption to recognise \class{} and typewriter-font wrappers (\texttt/{\tt}/\ttfamily), clearing 8 FPs (3 surveillance \class, 5 xts {\tt}) before adjudicating the remainder. Capital-after-hyphen deliberately not enforced.

### Findings / suggestions

Added a **capital-after-colon** check to JSS-CAP-001 (title style) and
JSS-CAP-002 (sentence style). The JSS style guide requires capitalising
"the first word after a colon" in both styles; the tool previously
enforced this only for BibTeX titles (JSS-REFS-006). The colon is
enforced; **capital-after-hyphen is deliberately NOT enforced** (a
literal reading would demand "Model-Based clustering", contradicting the
universal compound-modifier convention) — documented in the catalogue
notes.

**Firing count:** 65 new after-colon firings across the pinned corpus
(3 JSS-CAP-001, 62 JSS-CAP-002).

**TP/FP split:** 64 TP, 1 FP (98.5% precision on the new direction).

**Adjudication convention** (reviewer tag `ai:claude-opus-4.8-colon-audit`):
- lowercase prose word after a colon = **TP** (sentence/title style
  requires the capital);
- bare lowercase dataset / package / code identifier after a colon =
  **TP** with reason "identifier should be capitalised or markup-wrapped"
  (the guide requires capitalise-or-markup) — 5 such rows (`icons`,
  `hbk` ×2, `solder.balance`, `usmacro`);
- the sole **FP** is `useR!` (cran_movMF §"Application: useR! 2008
  abstracts") — a proper-noun conference/brand name that is canonically
  lowercase; the rule cannot gazetteer it.

**Mid-loop FP-class fix:** the first scan produced an FP class (≥5) where
the token after the colon *was* markup-wrapped but in a macro the
exemption did not recognise — 3 surveillance `\class{...}` (S4 class
names) and 5 xts `{\tt ...}` typewriter-font code tokens. The after-colon
markup exemption was extended to also recognise `\class`, `\texttt`,
`{\tt ...}`, and `\ttfamily`; after rescan those 8 no longer fire, and
only the remaining 65 were adjudicated.

### Plan

Shipped in branch `021-colon-caps`: Python
(`journals/jss/rules/capitalization.py`) and Rust
(`rust/jsslint-core/src/rules/capitalization.rs`) kept in behavioural
lockstep; TDD unit tests in `tests/unit/rules/test_capitalization.py`;
catalogue `notes`/`explanation` for CAP-001/CAP-002 updated (descriptions
and violation messages unchanged, preserving the eval label key).

### Results (post-implementation)

- `JSS-CAP-001` (full corpus): tp 115→118 (**+3**), fp 0→0, pending 0.
- `JSS-CAP-002` (full corpus): tp 578→639 (**+61**), fp 10→11 (**+1**),
  pending 0.
- `JSS-CAP-001` (pinned): tp 59→61 (**+2**), fp 0→0.
- `JSS-CAP-002` (pinned): tp 361→409 (**+48**), fp 7→8 (**+1**).
- All per-rule precision gates remain PASS; 0 pending after adjudication.

## Iteration 114 — 2026-07-19T07:35:57Z — post-multifile-resolve

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `1.0.1`
- **Parse failures:** full=26, pinned=16

**Note:** Post-implementation snapshot: spec 013 \input/\include/\subfile/\bibliography auto-resolution activated on both engines (JSS-PROJECT-001/002 added, marked deterministic), plus 3 resolver bugs fixed after eval review (comment-stripping, nested-brace macro args, root-relative path resolution).

**Pinned only**

_(no rule-level changes)_

### Findings / suggestions

Shipped spec 013's `\input`/`\include`/`\subfile`/`\bibliography`
auto-resolution on both engines (previously a dormant resolver, wired
in for the first time), plus two new tool-side rules,
`JSS-PROJECT-001` (cycle) and `JSS-PROJECT-002` (missing reference),
both marked deterministic in the catalogue.

**Zero real-world exercise of the two new rules on this corpus.**
Neither appears in the stats tables above because neither has a single
violation recorded (0 tp, 0 fp, 0 pending) — no genuine `\input` cycle
and no genuine unresolved reference exists anywhere in the 255-paper
corpus once auto-resolve is on. An earlier scan (before the fixes
below) *did* fire `JSS-PROJECT-002` 8 times; all 8 were false
positives, traced and fixed (see "Plan").

**294 new `pending` findings, 0 new tp/fp, full corpus only (pinned:
0).** Auto-resolve now follows each paper's `\input`/`\include`/
`\bibliography` graph into sibling files that were never fed to
`jss-lint` directly before, so every ordinary rule that fires in one
of those newly-reachable files shows up as a brand-new, unreviewed
violation. Concentrated in `JSS-REFS-003/004/006` (+34/+37/+25,
mostly `.bib` files pulled in via `\bibliography`), `JSS-CODE-003`
(+36), `JSS-MARKUP-001` (+34), `JSS-CAP-002` (+30). None of this
reflects a rule regression — it's corpus-coverage growth, and needs an
`eval-review` pass before it means anything precision-wise.

### Plan

No further code changes from this iteration's own scope — this is a
snapshot of `main` after two prior commits: `96d1307` (feature) and
`aaa6b37` (fix, informed by a scan of this exact corpus). That fix
commit closed three false-positive classes in the resolver's macro
walk, found by manually tracing all 8 `JSS-PROJECT-002` hits from the
pre-fix scan:
- unstripped TeX comments (`%\bibliography{bibliojss}` etc. — 3 hits,
  plus, found afterward while answering a follow-up question, 2 more
  in `cran_matchingMarkets` that weren't even reported as `missing`
  since the commented-out targets happened to exist on disk and were
  silently pulled into the lint set instead);
- unbalanced-brace macro arguments (Sweave's
  `\bibliography{\Sexpr{Rcpp:::bib()}}` truncating at the first `}` —
  1 hit; any argument containing a macro invocation is now skipped
  rather than resolved or reported missing);
- parent-relative instead of root-relative path resolution for nested
  `\input`s (`cran_gems`'s `script/technical.tex` doing
  `\input{fig/dag4haz}`, a path that only exists beside the root
  document, not beside `technical.tex` — 4 hits).

Next iteration should run `eval-review`/`eval-human-review` over the
294 new pending findings before drawing any precision conclusions from
this snapshot — they're currently unlabelled, so the full-corpus
precision percentages above are computed over a smaller reviewed
subset than the raw counts suggest.

### Results (post-implementation)

- `JSS-PROJECT-001`/`JSS-PROJECT-002`: 0 tp, 0 fp, 0 pending — no
  firings anywhere in the corpus (post-fix). No precision signal yet;
  revisit once a real multi-file JSS paper with an actual graph
  problem shows up in a future corpus addition.
- No existing rule's tp/fp changed. 294 new `pending` violations
  appeared across 25 rules (full corpus only), from files auto-resolve
  now reaches that weren't scanned before — needs `eval-review`, not a
  code change.
- All per-rule precision gates remain PASS (the two rules with
  non-PASS status, `JSS-CITE-002` pinned FAIL and `JSS-MARKUP-001`
  EXEMPT, are both pre-existing and unrelated to this change).

## Iteration 115 — 2026-07-19T08:39:56Z — new-additions-through-resolve-input

- **Corpus size:** 255 papers
- **Tool version:** `1.0.1`
- **Parse failures:** full=26, pinned=16

**Note:** AI review pass over the 294 new pending findings from post-multifile-resolve (iter 114): 265 tp / 19 fp / 16 uncertain.

### Findings / suggestions

Closes the loop on iteration 114's 294 new pending findings (the files
auto-resolve started reaching for the first time — see iter 114). AI
review (`eval-jss review --routing eval/review-routing.toml`, Bonsai +
Qwen3-30B) labelled 284/300 with high confidence; the remaining 16
`uncertain` rows were adjudicated by hand (`eval-jss human-review`,
reviewer tag `human:unknown`). Combined result: **275 tp / 25 fp / 0
pending** across the batch — 91.7% precision on newly-surfaced
findings, no rule regressions.

`JSS-MARKUP-001` absorbed most of the FPs (13 tp / 21 fp on this
batch), consistent with its existing `EXEMPT` status — not new, just
more exposure. The human adjudication surfaced two concrete FP
*classes* worth a future look, not urgent:
- **`JSS-CODE-003`** (2 FP): flags `=` inside Bash variable
  assignments (`--configure-args="--disable-opa"`) and shell operator
  spacing as if it were R/`\code{}` operator spacing — Bash's
  `NAME=value` has no spaces by syntax, so the "add spaces around
  operators" rule doesn't apply to it.
- **`JSS-MARKUP-001`** (2 of the 4 FP): flags tokens inside a
  paper-local custom environment (`\begin{lst}`, defined in
  `00-preamble.tex` as an alias for `verbatim`) as bare
  programming-language names needing `\proglang{}` — the rule's
  verbatim-context exemption doesn't recognise author-defined
  environment aliases, only the built-in ones.

Both are narrow, corpus-specific edge cases (one Bash-in-Sinput
snippet, one custom verbatim alias) rather than systemic problems —
noted here for a future iteration, not actioned in this one.

`JSS-PROJECT-001`/`JSS-PROJECT-002` had nothing to adjudicate — still
zero firings anywhere in the corpus after the iter-114 fix.

### Plan

No code changes in this iteration — purely a review/adjudication pass
closing out iteration 114's backlog. Next candidate work, if picked
up: the two FP classes above (`JSS-CODE-003` Bash assignment operators,
`JSS-MARKUP-001` custom verbatim-alias environments).

### Results (post-implementation)

- 300/300 of the resolve-rollout's new findings adjudicated: 275 tp,
  25 fp, 0 pending (91.7% precision on the batch).
- `JSS-MARKUP-001`: 13 tp / 21 fp on this batch (pre-existing `EXEMPT`
  rule, not a regression).
- Two narrow FP classes identified for a future iteration:
  `JSS-CODE-003` on Bash `NAME=value` assignments, `JSS-MARKUP-001` on
  paper-local custom verbatim-environment aliases.
- `JSS-PROJECT-001`/`JSS-PROJECT-002`: still 0 tp / 0 fp / 0 pending —
  no real-world exercise yet in this corpus.
- All per-rule precision gates PASS except the two pre-existing,
  unrelated exceptions (`JSS-CITE-002` pinned FAIL, `JSS-MARKUP-001`
  EXEMPT).
