# Working in this repo

Two engines, one behavior. `src/texlint/` (Python) is the reference
implementation; `rust/` is a workspace porting it to a CLI (`jsslint-cli`),
browser/npm WASM (`jsslint-wasm`, also powering `web/` and
`vscode-extension/`), a PyO3 wheel (`jsslint-py`), and an R package
(`r/jsslintr/`, which vendors the core via
`r/jsslintr/tools/vendor-jsslint-core.sh`). See `rust/README.md` for the
tool-by-tool guide.

Non-negotiable invariants (Constitution §XIII–§XV — CI-enforced, don't fight
the guards, fix the cause):

- **Engine parity**: any rule/behavior change lands in BOTH engines and must
  keep `terminal`/`json`/`sarif`/`html` output byte-identical. Enforced by
  `rust/*/tests/*_parity.rs`, `tests/unit/test_jsslint_parity.py`, and the R
  testthat suite (all skip cleanly when the gitignored eval corpus isn't
  materialized — `eval-jss corpus fetch` + `python -m
  eval.recall_corpus_scaffold` to fetch it).
- **Portable-core isolation**: no network/filesystem code in `jsslint-core`,
  `jsslint-wasm`, `jsslint-py`, or the vendored R crate. Network lives in
  `rust/jsslint-crossref/` (CLI-only); filesystem concerns live at the
  CLI/binding layer. Guarded by `rust/jsslint-wasm/tests/isolation.rs`.
- **Single-source version**: edit `VERSION` and run
  `python scripts/set_version.py` — never hand-edit a manifest version.
  Guarded by `tests/unit/test_version_single_source.py`.

Everyday commands (venv at `.venv`, Python 3.12):

```sh
export PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"   # both needed
python -m pytest tests/ -q            # Python suite (needs .venv/bin on PATH:
                                      #   eval tests shell out to `jss-lint`)
ruff check .                          # lint gate (CI runs exactly this)
(cd rust && cargo test --workspace)   # Rust suite incl. parity + isolation
R CMD INSTALL --library=$HOME/R/library r/jsslintr   # R package build
```

Release flow: tag-triggered workflows publish per component
(`vX.Y.Z-cli|-py|-pypkg|-wasm|-vscode`, plain `vX.Y.Z` for the Action —
push tags to the public remote only). PyPI/npm use OIDC trusted publishing.
`vscode-extension/` runs the checker in-process from the bundled WASM
(`npm run build:wasm`); it has no Python or binary dependency.
